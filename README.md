# gtfs-bus-stops

This project was made as a utility for me to better visualise the bus stops in my country.

It includes the following:
* A use of node-gtfs package: https://github.com/brendannee/node-gtfs
* A web application with a web interface to interact with google
  * The web application was made with NodeJS, Express and pure javascript for client side.

Note that in order to use the web application you're going to have to load the information with the GTFS API for your country (if it's available).
